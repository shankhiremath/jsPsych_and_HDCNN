# Multialternative detection task

Following fixation of a central '+' sign, the observer is presented with 4 oriented gratings. At a random time following stimulus onset, the display goes blank briefly (a few hundred milliseconds). Then, the four stimuli reappear. In some proportion of the trials, one of the four gratings has changes in orientation (change trials), and in the remaining trials, none of the stimuli changes (catch trials). The observer is rewarded for saccading to the location of the change (change trials) or for maintaining fixation in trials when no change occurred (catch trials).
